# Two-Factor Authentication for ATM System
The Facial Recognition System that is implemented in this project will integrate a facial recognition module to the existing ATM cash withdrawal process thus adding a 2-step verification alongside the pin authentication module.
The customers will need to go through a facial recognition phase as they simultaneously go through the pin authentication process.
<br/>In this facial recognition module, we have proposed Inception-ResNet V1 as the machine learning CNN model to identify faces of the bank's customers.
The model has been initially trained on sample faces to capture the characteristics of a human face and subsequently trained on the LFW dataset with more than two hundred classes thereby providing better accuracy.

---------------
Step 1:
<br/>Install all the necessary packages using [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Big-Data-And-Data-Analytics/Face_PIN_2step_Authen/blob/master/Documents/requirements.txt)
<br/>
<br/>Step 1.a:
<br/>Follow the steps present in [Document/]() to install all the necessary python packages using requirements.txt
<br/>
<br/>Step 2
<br/>Start the application by running the python file [gui.py](https://github.com/Big-Data-And-Data-Analytics/Face_PIN_2step_Authen/blob/master/gui.py)
